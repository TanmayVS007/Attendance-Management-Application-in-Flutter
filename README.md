# Attendance Go

In today's dynamic world, technology is reshaping education, prompting institutions to seek modern solutions. Student attendance management, traditionally manual, faces challenges. Geofencing, an innovative location-based technology, can transform this process by creating virtual boundaries in classrooms. Flutter, a versatile cross-platform mobile app development framework, facilitates the creation of an accessible attendance management app. This project aims to modernize attendance tracking, enhancing accuracy, reducing time, enabling real-time monitoring, and providing data insights for informed decision-making in education. It addresses the limitations of traditional methods, promising a user-friendly and efficient system. Stay tuned for insights into technical implementation and challenges as the project unfolds.

## Methods Used

```bas
1. Geofencing: Utilized to define virtual boundaries, enabling location-based triggers or alerts.

2. Matching the Correct Number: A verification process ensuring the accuracy of provided numbers.

3. IMEI Tracking System: Implemented to track and identify devices uniquely, preventing multiple logins with different IDs from the same device.
```
## Usage
### Teachers Usage: 

    1. Install the app and grant necessary permissions.

    2. Register with accurate credentials and log in.

    3. To create courses, click on the plus button located at the top-right corner.

    4. Enter the desired group name and proceed by clicking on the "Generate Code" button.

    5. Share the generated code with the students so they can enter the created course.

    6. Attendance can be marked using two methods: either through geofencing, which relies on location-based boundaries, or by matching the correct number, providing an additional layer of authentication. Both methods are accessible in the bottom menu.

    7. To mark attendance by matching the correct number, follow these steps:

        i. Click on the bottom menu and select the first option.

        ii. A code will be generated; provide this code to the students. The code will be available for 5 seconds.

        iii. Students should choose the correct option within this time frame to mark their attendance as present.

        iv. A popup will appear, displaying the list of present and absent students.

        v. In the popup, you can download an Excel file containing the details of present and absent students.

### Student Usage 


    1. Install the app and grant required permissions.

    2. Register with accurate credentials and log in.

    3. To join the course using the code generated by the teacher, click on the plus icon located at the top-right and enter the provided code.

    4. To mark your attendance, open the course, click on "Mark My Attendance," select the correct code provided by the teacher, and then submit. Your attendance will be successfully marked.
## Features


- **Geofencing Technology:** Your system leverages geofencing technology, ensuring that students can mark their attendance only when they are physically present within the designated classroom or campus area. This feature sets your solution apart by eliminating the risk of proxy attendance and ensuring the accuracy and authenticity of attendance records.

- **One-Time Unique Number System:** Each attendance session generates a one-time unique number for students to use. This unique number is exclusive to each session, reducing the possibility of number sharing and fraud. This feature enhances the security of the attendance system and ensures that attendance is recorded only once per session.

- **Time-Bound Attendance Marking:** Your system enforces a specific time window during which students must mark their attendance. This not only encourages punctuality but also ensures that attendance is recorded promptly. The system reduces the chances of late arrivals or fraudulent attendance marks.

- **Self-Service Enrollment for Students:** Students can autonomously join courses by using course codes created by teachers, streamlining the enrollment process. This self-service feature empowers students to take control of their course enrollments and reduces administrative overhead.

- **Real-Time Data and Analytics:** Teachers have access to real-time data and analytics on student attendance. This empowers educators to make data-driven decisions regarding student engagement and academic performance. They can identify attendance issues and address them promptly, ultimately improving the quality of education.

- **Teacher Empowerment:** Teachers can approve device change requests and manage student enrollments within their courses. This feature reduces administrative workload for educators and provides them with greater control and autonomy in managing their classes.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The system boasts an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making attendance tracking straightforward for both teachers and students. This ease of use reduces the learning curve and enhances the user experience.

- **Integration with Educational Ecosystem:** Your system seamlessly integrates with existing Learning Management Systems (LMS) and other educational tools, providing familiarity and efficiency for institutions already using these platforms. This integration ensures a smooth transition and compatibility with their existing systems.

- **Scalability:** Your solution is designed to adapt to the needs of both small colleges and large universities, providing a versatile and scalable attendance management system suitable for institutions of various sizes and growth stages.
